This script generates hands which call for the Blackwood and Gerber conventions.  This isn't a fully random selection.

Gerber auctions contain balanced opening hands with 15-24 HCP, so opening 1NT, 1x/2NT, 2NT, and 2C/2NT sequences.

Blackwood auctions contain 1M opening hands and strong support by responder, so the auctions are assumed to be 1M (pass) 4NT.

At this stage, students don't know keycard blackwood, so responses are standard.

Frequency: 1.2 out of 1000 hands.

Standard distribution is 86% Blackwood.
Leveled distribution is 43% Blackwood.
